Once Upon A Time (ouat) is an esoteric programming language which aims to be as english-ish as possible!
Its still in the stage of development. Documentation is not available as of now.

# Example
This piece of ouat code divides 328 by 50
```
(Lets divide two numbers, Bill and Mark)

Bill is ceo of facebook (The hero) whereas Mark is punk stupid (The villain).
Always, Mark is with gang.

Jade is a girl. Jade is without spider-man SO Jade is without cap.
Although, I am nothing.

While Bill is better than Mark, Bill is without Mark, I am with Jade.
```
It gets transcompiled to javascript as,
```
Bill =328  ; Mark =46 ;
;; Mark +=4;

Jade =14; Jade -=10 ; Jade -=3;
;; I =0;

while(Bill > Mark) {  Bill -= Mark; I += Jade }
```
